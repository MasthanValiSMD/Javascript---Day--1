2. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP2 is much better than HTTP1.1
*HTTP1 loads a single request for every tcp connection , while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing,
*HTTP1 keeps all requests and responses in text format ,but HTTP2 uses binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format,
*HTTP1 does'nt allow server to "push" responses , but HTTP2 allows server to "push"responses proactively into client caches,
*HTTP2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK to reduce overhead,
*HTTP2 is fully multiplexed ,instead of ordered and blocking,
*HTTP2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP1.1 did not anticipate,
*HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1
*HTTP2 is faster than HTTP1.1 in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
